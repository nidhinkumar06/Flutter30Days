  <h1>Flutter - Day 21</h1>
  <p>Flutter Widgets - SilverAppBar</p>
</div>

SilverAppBar is like when you scroll the list view you could see a image being dropped out similar like Android Custom AppBar

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/Day21/customappbar.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
 </div>


It can be achieved using SilverAppBar widget in flutter. SilverAppBar is used with `CustomScrollView` to provide custom scroll behaviour of the app bar

<div align="center">
  <img src="../../assets/Day21/silverareas.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
</div>


we can set the expandableHeight as well as flexibleSpace inside the silverAppBar like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/Day21/silverappbar.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
 </div>

set the floating parameter to true to make the appbar reappear when it is scrolled down
