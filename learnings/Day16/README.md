To tap a button or icon how to add interactivity for the widgets

A widget is either `stateful` or `stateless`. If a widget can change—when a user interacts with it, for example—it’s stateful.

A stateless widget never changes. `Icon`, `IconButton`, and `Text` are examples of stateless widgets. Stateless widgets subclass StatelessWidget.

A stateful widget is dynamic: for example, it can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data. `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Slider`, `InkWell`, `Form`, and `TextField` are examples of stateful widgets. Stateful widgets subclass StatefulWidget.

A widget’s state is stored in a State object, separating the widget’s state from its appearance. The state consists of values that can change, like a slider’s current value or whether a checkbox is checked. When the widget’s state changes, the state object calls `setState()`, telling the framework to redraw the widget.
