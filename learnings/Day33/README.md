# Container

Do you have a widget that needs some styling like background color, shape, or some size constraints? Try wrapping it in a Container widget! The Container widget helps you compose, decorate, and position child widgets.

For example if we have a text widget and we want to have a background for it we can do it using `Container` widget.
Once the Container widget is added we can set the width, height, padding, margin etc. for the Container

If we want the container to have a circle shape we can do it using the `BoxDecoration` through which we can set a shape to the widget like circle

Even for the `BoxDecoration` we can set the Width and Height
