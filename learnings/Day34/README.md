# Selectable Text

If you app needs an Select copy option then you can use the `selectable text` using which we can copy or share the selected text.

To have the selected text we will be having the snippet like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/Day34/selectabletext.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
</div>

Suppose if we have text with scrollable option we can have the scrollable feature like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/Day34/scrollableTExt.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
</div>

# Data Table

To have a table in our Flutter application we can use the Data Table widget option through which we can show the data in a tabular format like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/Day34/datatable.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
</div>

The syntax for the data table is like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/Day34/datatablesyntax.png" alt="flutter" height="300">
</div>

We can have the sort option for the table even we can add the widgets inside each cell as well add icons for each cell
